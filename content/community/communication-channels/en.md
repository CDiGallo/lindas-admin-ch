## Communication channels

The LINDAS team uses several communication channels to keep its users informed.

For employees of the federal administration, there's the [Linked Data in der Bundesverwaltung](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI2ODU3NTU1OTY5In0) community on Viva Engage (formerly Yammer), which provides information on interesting events and republishes articles on the subject of linked data.

For the public, we are present on the following social networks:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CH_Bundesarchiv)
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bar-afs)
