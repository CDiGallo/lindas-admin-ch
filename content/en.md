### LINDAS

The [Swiss Federal Archives](https://www.bar.admin.ch/bar/en/home.html) provides the Linked Data Service LINDAS. This service includes a tool for data conversion and data integration as well as a data storage infrastructure (Triplestore). 

Via LINDAS, Swiss authorities can make their data available in the form of Knowledge Graphs. Developers can access this data via the [Query Data section](https://lindas.admin.ch/sparql/).

The [Federal Office for the Environment](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html) uses LINDAS to make environmental data accessible to humans and machines and has developed [Visualize](https://www.visualize.admin.ch/en), a web application for the visualization of data sets. With this tool, data provided by LINDAS can be visualized and embedded in web pages.
