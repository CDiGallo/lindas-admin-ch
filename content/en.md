### LINDAS

The [Federal Archives](https://www.bar.admin.ch/) are conducting a Linked Data project designed to develop the linked data service LINDAS. By the end of 2020 LINDAS will provide a tool for data conversion and data integration, a triplestore (data storage) and a visualization tool. The visualization tool is being developed by the [Federal Office for the Environment](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/). Further information can be found on the [eGovernment Switzerland website](https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/e-government-schweiz-2008-2015/lindas/).
