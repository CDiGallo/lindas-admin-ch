# Publication of government data

With the help of LINDAS, any public administration in Switzerland can make its open government data (OGD) available in the form of Linked Opend Data (LOD).

Furthermore, LINDAS can also be used for Closed Government Data, i.e. data that is only visible within the administration. This means that the advantages of Linked Data can also be used internally within the administration.

## Procedure

An annual fee is charged for hosting data on LINDAS to cover the operating costs of the infrastructure. All relevant details can be found [here](https://www.bar.admin.ch/dam/bar/de/dokumente/diverses/lindas_dienstleistung.pdf.download.pdf/LINDAS_Dienstleistung_de.pdf) (only available in German).

## Data protection and legal issues

If data is to be published as Open Government Data (OGD), it must meet the relevant requirements for publication. These are defined in the [OGD Guidelines](https://handbook.opendata.swiss/de/content/glossar/bibliothek/ogd-richtlinien.html) (only available in DE/FR).
