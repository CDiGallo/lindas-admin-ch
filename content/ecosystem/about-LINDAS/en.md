# LINDAS

The [Swiss Federal Archives (SFA)](https://www.bar.admin.ch/bar/en/home.html) provide the Linked Data Service LINDAS.

This service includes a set of tools for publishing and using Linked Data.

Through LINDAS, Swiss authorities can make their data available in the form of Knowledge Graphs. This can be done for open government data (Linked Open Data) aimed at the general public as well as for data internal to the administration.

The following video gives a good insight into the basic possibilities of LINDAS:
