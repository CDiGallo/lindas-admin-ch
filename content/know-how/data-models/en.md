# Tabular data: cube.link

Tabular data can be transformed into Linked Data using the [cube.link](https://cube.link) ontology. An aid for this is the Cube Creator, which was created specifically for data integration in LINDAS.

# Versioned Data: version.link

If resources change over time and the temporal evolution is important, the [version.link](https://version.link) ontology can be used to map this temporal evolution.
