## Linked Data Tools

This section lists a variety of software tools to work with Linked Data.

### Data Transformation (Extract Transform Load - ETL)

* [RML.io](https://rml.io/): Generate knowledge graphs - Applications for Linux, Windows, and macOS machines for generating knowledge graphs. They rely on declarative rules that define how the knowledge graphs are generated.
* [CARML](https://github.com/carml/carml): CARML is a java library that transforms structured sources to RDF as declared in an RML mapping, in accordance with the RML spec.
* [Ontop](https://ontop-vkg.org/): Ontop is a Virtual Knowledge Graph system. It exposes the content of arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. These graphs are virtual, which means that data remains in the data sources instead of being moved to another database.
